# YADA - Yet Another Design Adventure

An HTML, CSS, Javascript Framework.

## Opinionated

YADA uses SASS, BABEL and Webpack.

To achieve low specificity and highly explicit CSS, YADA uses the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) CSS naming convention.

Most importantly, the framework is intended to be minimalistic and doesn't attempt to boil the ocean.

## Important

Like all adventures, this project is a work in progress. See [Things To Do](#things-to-do) below.

## Things To Do

+ Add more components. Obviously this one is where the WIP comes from.
+ Accessibility.
+ <del>Carousel desperately needs to be revisited and might merit its own separate project.</del>
+ Constant refactoring.
+ A React version? Maybe?
