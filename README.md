# YADA - Yet Another Design Adventure

An HTML, CSS, Javascript Framework.

## Opinionated

YADA uses SASS, BABEL and Webpack.

To achieve low specificity, high explicity, Yada uses the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) CSS naming convention.

Most importantly, the framework is intended to be minimalistic and doesn't attempt to boil the ocean.

## Important

Like all adventures, this project is a work in progress.

## Coming Soon... Maybe?

A React version... Maybe?
