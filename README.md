# YADA - Yet Another Design Adventure

An HTML, CSS, Javascript Framework.

## Opinionated

YADA uses SASS, BABEL and Webpack.

To achieve low specificity and highly explicit CSS, YADA uses the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) CSS naming convention with a few exceptions.

Most importantly, the framework is intended to be minimalistic and doesn't attempt to boil the ocean.

## Important

Like all adventures, this project is a work in progress. See [Things To Do](#things-to-do) below.

## Things To Do

+ Constant refactoring...
+ Add more components. Obviously! This is where the WIP comes from.
+ Accessibility.
+ A Web Component version based on Polymer? Maybe?
+ A React version? Maybe?
